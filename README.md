### Description

[No code update; only added the missing RTF file]. Fastest non-tiled graph path finder. Extended my unique approach &amp; believe it is 100% accurate and still very fast. This approach uses window regions to process open space very quickly. Where A* &amp; Dijkstra require known distances between nodes, this project kinda explores on the fly, creating the needed link structure as it explores. Give it a go &amp; if you want to discuss better logic/routines, please email me. P.S. Sorry about the large screenshot: wanted to show you the size of a graph &amp; it's potential speed. Thanx goes to Stavros Sirigos for getting me re-interested in this project. Updated: a bit faster &amp; fixed routine to recognize when start/end nodes in same regional rectangle. Updated 18Jun: added efficiency tweaks &amp; correct path error that occurs maybe 1 out of 1000 paths.
